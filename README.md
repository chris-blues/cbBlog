# cbBlog v0.14-dev
This is the bleedin edge developer version. This is to be considered in the experimental stage. For productive use, get the latest [release](https://github.com/chris-blues/cbBlog/releases)!

## At the moment I'm refactoring the code. Expect the branch next to be completely non-functional, well very experimental.
## Again: if you want a functional version, use the latest [release](https://github.com/chris-blues/cbBlog/releases)!
